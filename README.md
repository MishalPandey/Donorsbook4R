Blood Donation App
# About
• Created a APP with Android Studio and Firebase. The app shall allow for User
 authentication, Saving data to database,   Retrieving data from firebase database, Sending Emails
 directly from the android app without using intents or the Gmail app.\
• We also implemented Notifications to allow registered donors in our DONORSBOOK APP to be Notified
  once a recipient sends them an email.
  
  # What I used in it :
• Firebase : I Used Google's firebase to manage authentication using email and password, also for store data in firestore.\
• JAVA, XML language.
